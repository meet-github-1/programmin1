/*
Amith decided go on a holiday trip. 
Given a map of N holiday spots numbered 0,1,2,.. N-1, map shows the connecting routes
between the holiday sopts, the routes are bidirectional, and
the connecting routes are indicates as routes[i] = [from , to , distance ]. 
He can travel only a certian distance D.

Your task is to find the holiday spot H with the smallest number of holiday spots
that are reachable from H and whose distance is at most D, 

If there are multiple holiday spots, return H with the greatest number.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1 -> Three integers, N number of holiday spots, R is the number of connecting routes
          and D is the distance can travel.
Next R lines -> Three space separated integers, from , to and distance.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, holiday spot.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
4 4 4
0 1 3
1 2 1
1 3 4
2 3 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
3


Explanation:
------------
Distance can travel= 4,

From			Reachable sopts
-------------------------------------
Holiday-spot 0 -> [Holiday-spot 1, Holiday-spot 2] 
Holiday-spot 1 -> [Holiday-spot 0, Holiday-spot 2, Holiday-spot 3] 
Holiday-spot 2 -> [Holiday-spot 0, Holiday-spot 1, Holiday-spot 3] 
Holiday-spot 3 -> [Holiday-spot 1, Holiday-spot 2] 

Holiday-spots 0 and 3 have 2 reachable Holiday-spots at a distance = 4, 
but we have to return Holiday-spot 3 since it has the greatest number.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
5 6 2
0 1 2
0 4 8
1 2 3
1 4 2
2 3 1
3 4 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
0

Explanation:
------------
Distance can travel= 2,

From			Reachable sopts
-------------------------------------
Holiday-spot 0 -> [Holiday-spot 1] 
Holiday-spot 1 -> [Holiday-spot 0, Holiday-spot 4] 
Holiday-spot 2 -> [Holiday-spot 3, Holiday-spot 4] 
Holiday-spot 3 -> [Holiday-spot 2, Holiday-spot 4]
Holiday-spot 4 -> [Holiday-spot 1, Holiday-spot 2, Holiday-spot 3]

Holiday-spots 0 has 1 reachable Holiday-spot at a distance = 2,
